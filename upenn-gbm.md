The University of Pennsylvania glioblastoma (UPenn-GBM) cohort: advanced MRI, clinical, genomics, & radiomics

This dataset from the University of Pennsylvania Health System consists of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans of de novo Glioblastoma (GBM) patients, along with patient information, clinical outcomes, genomic data, and tumor progression. The collection includes computer-aided and manually-corrected segmentation labels of various tumor sub-regions, as well as the whole brain, in NIfTI format. The scans underwent skull-stripping and co-registration, with the tumor segmentation labels revised and approved by neuroradiologists. The dataset provides a range of radiomic features, allowing for comprehensive computational and clinical studies, and can be used as gold standard labels for performance evaluation in computational challenges. Additionally, the dataset includes H&E-stained digitized tissue sections from resected tumor specimens.
